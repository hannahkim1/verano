            <p>The term "bossa nova" literally translates to new flair, or new trend in Portuguese. </p>
            
            <p>
                Originating in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the late 1950s, bossa nova has brought the unique culture of Brazilian samba and American jazz together. 
                Bossa nova music relies on the singer and simple instruments, to create the iconic gentle and simple rhythm. 
                Rio de Janeiro's sunny beaches were the ultimate influence on the beautifully poetic yet, simplistic lyrics. 
                The lyrics written in Portuguese portray stories of love and the slow paced daily life in Rio. 
                Bossa nova promoted this beautiful idea of paradise, a beautiful language with romantic imagery of calming beaches and euphoria. 
                Bossa nova gives the listener a feeling of nostalgia- even if the listener had never experienced the unique lifestyle of Rio.

                Bossa nova was created in the 1950s, and became a Brazilian classic. 
                The bossa nova sound was loved throughout the 50s in Brazil, and it wasn't until the 60s when America joined the fun. 
                Bossa nova not just a music genre, but was also a representation of a small point in Brazilian history. 
                This brief bossa nova period of time was a "period of democracy... in between two spells of military dictatorship" (Lewis). 
                New architecture, new social rights, and two new football World Cup victories. Bossa nova represented the pride of Brazil at this time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The middle class Brazilians in the Copacabana neighborhood were the vital spine in bossa nova music. 
                The middle class students and struggling musicians who were regulars at the local jazz clubs 
                yet have also been exposed to American pop culture and media were inspired to create a fresh, young, sound. 
                However, with this happy and carefree music genre becoming more popular, many were critical of the seemingly zero class consciousness
                and alienation from actual Brazilian culture that bossa nova was presenting. Singing about beautiful women and bright, 
                blue skies was not necessarily thought provoking. 
                As this criticism for deeper-meaning music continued, bossa nova music began to die down in Brazil, but began getting more popular in the US. 
                Frank Sinatra was just one of the American musicians that fell in love with bossa nova and popularized it in America.

                As mentioned earlier, bossa nova is a fusion of Brazilian dance samba music and American smooth jazz. 
                Bossa nova included traditional Brazilian rhythms but added complex jazz harmonies. 
                Bossa nova has very few instruments, including the guitar, berimbau (musical bow), surdo (bass drum), and piano, to emphasize that simplistic sound. 
                Bossa nova rhythm is a two bar pattern influenced by the syncopated claves in Afro-Cuban and traditional samba music. 
                This combined with a slower tempo gives a unique sound.

            <p>Let's analyze the lyrics of arguably the most famous bossa nova songs:

                Num doce balanço, a caminho do mar <br>
                Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema <br>
                O seu balançado, é mais que um poema <br>
                É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar <br>

                Ah, se ela soubesse <br>

            <!-- Artists -->

            <h4>Artists</h4>
            <p>
                Now, here's a quick run-down of some very important artists. 
                Born on January 25th, 1927, Antonio Carlos Jobim (or Antonio Carlos Brasilerio de Almeida), also famously known as Tom Jobim, 
                was one of bossa nova's most influential artists. Jobim was a composer, a singer, a songwriter, a player of many instruments. 
                Jobim would play his music in jazz clubs in Rio before becoming the music director of one of the largest recording studios in Brazil, 
                Odeon Records. His most famous work of his is Garota de Ipanema and the soundtrack for the film Orfeu negro (which won an Academy award).
                He collaborated with many artists and produced wildly popular songs. Desafinado, Wave, and Corcovado are some of his most popular. 
                Joao Gilberto, living from June 10th 1931 to July 6th of 2019, was often considered the father of bossa nova. 
                His album collaborations with Jobim solidified the "founding blueprints for bossa nova style" (Daley)
                with his guitar rhythms and sultry songs. His then wife, Astrud Gilberto was arguably the most recognizable voices
                in bossa nova. Her and Stan Getz won a GRAMMY for "The Girl from Ipanema" and became an international star. 
                There are so many other notable and important artists that have influenced bossa nova, but Jobim, Joao and Astrud Gilberto 
                were the "golden trio" of bossa nova. With Jobim's brilliant songwriting, Joao's compositions, and Astrud's vocals, 
                their influence was unparalleled.

                Bossa nova is a beautiful music genre that does not get enough attention that it deserves. 
                Everyone has probably heard at least some form of bossa nova in their life. 
                Maybe at a coffee shop, or while playing a random youtube playlist to study to, or maybe a busker playing bossa nova on the piano. 
            </p>

            <p>
                New artists are embracing this easy-going and tranquil sound. 
                K-pop sensation girl-group, TWICE released their title song, Alcohol Free on their tenth mini album in 2021. 
                Alcohol Free includes elements of bossa nova, a refreshing and laidback take from their usual songs.

                Billie Eilish released her song Billie Bossa Nova in her Happier than Ever album in 2021. 
                It includes the classic lyrics of love and simple beats.

                The Netflix show, Coisa Mais Linda, or Girls from Ipanema in the US, 
                portrays a story of a young woman from the city breaking away from her family's strict rules and opens her own jazz club for her
                passion of bossa nova. The show has really beautiful shots of Rio and I fell in love with bossa nova at the exact same time as
                the main character, Malu, in the pilot episode. The soundtrack and cinematography was what made me obsessed. 
                This show, being produced by Netflix, introduced bossa nova to so many people, including myself.

                Not to be dramatic, but bossa nova has changed... my life. 
                After watching Coisa Mais Linda in December of 2021, I just was immediately attracted to it. 
                I listen to bossa nova everyday. When I study, when I get ready for the day, when someone asks me for a song request... 
                all bossa nova. I started learning Portuguese on Duolingo and bought many books from my local Barnes and Noble chasing that 
                sunny bossa nova feeling. Translating some of the songs' simple lyrics help me learn more Portuguese.

                I hope to see live performances in music clubs with aspiring musicians. 
                I hope to experience the rich culture and legacy that bossa nova has left behind in Rio de Janeiro.
